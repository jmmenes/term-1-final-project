- Your project contains a `README.md` file that explains what your project is and how to use it
- Your project is hosted on GitHub pages

## Recommendations

- Start out by creating your project's foundation in HTML.
- Frequently make commits in git to save your progress.
- Build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`.
- Keep your code meticulously organized as you go.
- Use proper indentation, whitespace, and comments.
- Try to write a function for each separate piece of functionality that exists in your code. This will make your code "modular" and easier to build off of.
- If you find yourself repeating code, think about how you could use either a loop or a new function to eliminate the repitition.
