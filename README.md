# Woo Sah, Mobile App

&nbsp;

## Motivation

I believe mental health is just as important as physical health. You need both of those.

&nbsp;

## Why

Purpose of app: To help people meditate, do yoga (stretch), or relax with a selection of curated music & sounds. We live in a noisy modern world full of distractions, stress, & constant bad news. This can hopefully be a tool to help people cope with their days if necessary.

&nbsp;

## Usage

The user can read an instructions pop up by clicking on a button on the mobile home page.
The use can also just click on an activity button of their choice & just hit play on the music. The music will keep playing until the tracks are finished or stop button is pressed.

&nbsp;

### Yoga Tutorial

The user can read a quick explanation. The user will then choose a yoga pose from the dropdown menu and once a selection has been made and "enter" is clicked, the user will see the name of the yoga pose in its original Sanskrit language at the top of the page, followed by a simple illustration of the pose and a how-to video for that pose.
